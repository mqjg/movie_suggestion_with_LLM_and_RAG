This is a simple implemntation of Retreival-Augmented-Generation (RAG), a process to provide vital context when querying a Large Language Model (LLM). In this repo I use an IMDB dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/imdb-data-with-descriptions) with information about genre, release date, and descriptions to provide movie information to the LLM. I then use chromaDB to embed the movie descriptions using OpenAI embeddings, then use langchain to prompt the LLM.
